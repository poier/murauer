![Comparison of results.](./images/result_comparison.png)  
We introduce a method to exploit unlabeled data, which improves results 
especially for highly distorted images and difficult poses. 
**Top:** ground truth. **Middle:** baseline trained with labeled data (synthetic and 100 real). 
**Bottom:** our result from training with the same labeled data and additional unlabeled real data.

## Abstract
Data labeling for learning 3D hand pose estimation models is a huge effort. 
Readily available, accurately labeled synthetic data has the potential to reduce the effort. 
However, to successfully exploit synthetic data, current state-of-the-art methods 
still require a large amount of labeled real data. 
In this work, we remove this requirement by learning to map from the features of 
real data to the features of synthetic data mainly using a large amount of 
synthetic and *unlabeled* real data. We exploit unlabeled data using two auxiliary objectives, 
which enforce that (i) the mapped representation is pose specific and (ii) at the same time, 
the distributions of real and synthetic data are aligned. 
While pose specifity is enforced by a self-supervisory signal requiring that 
the representation is predictive for the appearance from different views, 
distributions are aligned by an adversarial term. 
In this way, we can significantly improve the results of the baseline system, 
which does not use unlabeled data and outperform many recent approaches already 
with about 1% of the labeled real data. 
This presents a step towards faster deployment of learning based hand pose estimation, 
making it accessible for a larger range of applications.

Not perfect (e.g., some figures are assembled wrongly) 
but probably still easier to read on some devices.
